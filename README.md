#  mol iOS — my Swift Student Challenge 2024 submission

Hello! This is parallel universe mol. Check out the main WatchOS version: [tobyab/mol](https://github.com/tobyab/mol).

mol is an app that lets you view the periodic table, all of its elements AND all of their properties right from your iPhone. This was meant to be Apple Watch-only, but I was an idiot and didn't use Swift Playgrounds. So, here's the version of mol that I submitted. I'll combine the two repos together at some point.

mol is a (not to toot my own horn!) well-designed, native app that lets you view all of the elements on the periodic table; and their properties.

it does work on iPadOS as well, but I'd recommend using iOS.

— someone who doesn't understand chemistry. :)
